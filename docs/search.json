    "text": "Course Description and Objectives\nThe course enables students to navigate the entire predictive analytics pipeline skillfullyâ€”from data preparation and exploration to modeling, assessment, and interpretation. Throughout the course, learners engage with real-world examples and hands-on labs emphasizing essential programming and analytical skills. By exploring topics such as linear and logistic regression, classification, resampling methods, regularization techniques, tree-based approaches, support vector machines, and advanced learning paradigms (including neural networks and unsupervised methods), participants gain a robust theoretical understanding and practical experience. Ultimately, students will leave the course equipped to apply predictive models to data-driven problems, communicate their findings to diverse audiences, and critically evaluate model performance to inform strategic decision-making across various business contexts.\nCourse Website: https://davi-moreira.github.io/2025S_predictive_analytics_purdue_MGMT47400/\n\nInstructor: Professor Davi Moreira\n\nEmail: dmoreira@purdue.edu\nOffice: Young Hall 414\nVirtual Office hours: Zoom link in your Course Brightspace Page\nIndividual Appointments: Book time with me through the link in the course syllabus on your Course Brightspace Page or by appointment.",

To use Google Colab, you need a Google account and a stable internet connection. While optional, having tools like a local Python installation (e.g., Anaconda) or a Python IDE (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or VS Code) can be helpful for offline development. Additionally, browser extensions, such as those for VS Code integration, can enhance your experience but are not required. This makes Google Colab convenient and easy for Python programming and data science tasks.",
