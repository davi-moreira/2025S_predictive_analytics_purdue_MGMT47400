## Moving Beyond Linearity

The truth is never linear!  
Or almost never!

But often the linearity assumption is good enough.

When it's not...  

- polynomials,  
- step functions,  
- splines,  
- local regression, and  
- generalized additive models  

offer a lot of flexibility, without losing the ease and interpretability of linear models.


## Polynomial Regression

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \beta_3 x_i^3 + \dots + \beta_d x_i^d + \epsilon_i
$$

**Degree-4 Polynomial**

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_1-1.png") 
```

## Details

- Create new variables $X_1 = X, \, X_2 = X^2$, etc., and then treat as multiple linear regression.
- Not really interested in the coefficients; more interested in the fitted function values at any value $x_0$:  
$$
  \hat{f}(x_0) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_0 + \hat{\beta}_2 x_0^2 + \hat{\beta}_3 x_0^3 + \hat{\beta}_4 x_0^4.
$$
- Since $\hat{f}(x_0)$ is a linear function of the $\hat{\beta}_\ell$, can get a simple expression for *pointwise-variances* \(\text{Var}[\hat{f}(x_0)]\) at any value $x_0$. In the figure, we have computed the fit and pointwise standard errors on a grid of values for $x_0$. We show $\hat{f}(x_0) \pm 2 \cdot \text{se}[\hat{f}(x_0)]$.
- We either fix the degree $d$ at some reasonably low value or use cross-validation to choose $d$.


## Details continued

- Logistic regression follows naturally. For example, in the figure we model  
$$
  \text{Pr}(y_i > 250 \mid x_i) = \frac{\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \dots + \beta_d x_i^d)}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \dots + \beta_d x_i^d)}.
$$
- To get confidence intervals, compute upper and lower bounds on *on the logit scale*, and then invert to get on the probability scale.
- Can do separately on several variables—just stack the variables into one matrix, and separate out the pieces afterwards (see GAMs later).
- **Caveat**: Polynomials have notorious tail behavior — very bad for extrapolation.
- Can fit using $y \sim \text{poly}(x, \text{degree} = 3)$ in formula.


## Step Functions

Another way of creating transformations of a variable — cut the variable into distinct regions.  

$$
C_1(X) = I(X < 35), \quad C_2(X) = I(35 \leq X < 50), \dots, C_3(X) = I(X \geq 65)
$$

### Piecewise Constant

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_2-1.png") 
```


## Step functions continued

- Easy to work with. Creates a series of dummy variables representing each group.
- Useful way of creating interactions that are easy to interpret. For example, interaction effect of $\text{Year}$ and $\text{Age}$:  
$$
  I(\text{Year} < 2005) \cdot \text{Age}, \quad I(\text{Year} \geq 2005) \cdot \text{Age}
$$
  would allow for different linear functions in each age category.
- In R: `I(year < 2005)` or `cut(age, c(18, 25, 40, 65, 90))`.
- Choice of cutpoints or *knots* can be problematic. For creating nonlinearities, smoother alternatives such as *splines* are available.


## Piecewise Polynomials

- Instead of a single polynomial in $X$ over its whole domain, we can rather use different polynomials in regions defined by knots. E.g. (see figure)  
$$
  y_i =
  \begin{cases} 
  \beta_{01} + \beta_{11}x_i + \beta_{21}x_i^2 + \beta_{31}x_i^3 + \epsilon_i & \text{if } x_i < c; \\
  \beta_{02} + \beta_{12}x_i + \beta_{22}x_i^2 + \beta_{32}x_i^3 + \epsilon_i & \text{if } x_i \geq c.
  \end{cases}
$$

- Better to add constraints to the polynomials, e.g., continuity.
- *Splines* have the "maximum" amount of continuity.


## Splines Visualization

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_3-1.png") 
```


## Linear Splines

*A linear spline with knots at* $\xi_k, \, k = 1, \dots, K$ *is a piecewise linear polynomial continuous at each knot.*

We can represent this model as  

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 b_1(x_i) + \beta_2 b_2(x_i) + \cdots + \beta_{K+1} b_{K+1}(x_i) + \epsilon_i,
$$

where the $b_k$ are *basis functions*.

$$
b_1(x_i) = x_i
$$

$$
b_{k+1}(x_i) = (x_i - \xi_k)_+, \quad k = 1, \dots, K
$$

Here the $()_+$ means *positive part*; i.e.,  

$$
(x_i - \xi_k)_+ =
\begin{cases}
x_i - \xi_k & \text{if } x_i > \xi_k \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

```


## Cubic Splines

*A cubic spline with knots at* $\xi_k, \, k = 1, \dots, K$ *is a piecewise cubic polynomial with continuous derivatives up to order 2 at each knot.*

Again we can represent this model with truncated power basis functions:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 b_1(x_i) + \beta_2 b_2(x_i) + \cdots + \beta_{K+3} b_{K+3}(x_i) + \epsilon_i,
$$

$$
b_1(x_i) = x_i, \quad b_2(x_i) = x_i^2, \quad b_3(x_i) = x_i^3, \quad b_{k+3}(x_i) = (x_i - \xi_k)_+^3, \quad k = 1, \dots, K
$$

where  

$$
(x_i - \xi_k)_+^3 =
\begin{cases}
(x_i - \xi_k)^3 & \text{if } x_i > \xi_k, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_1_2-1.png") 
```

## Natural Cubic Splines

A natural cubic spline extrapolates linearly beyond the boundary knots. This adds $4 = 2 \times 2$ extra constraints, and allows us to put more internal knots for the same degrees of freedom as a regular cubic spline.

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_4-1.png") 
```

## Fitting Splines in R

Fitting splines in R is easy: `bs(x, ...)` for any degree splines, and `ns(x, ...)` for natural cubic splines, in package `splines`.

**Natural Cubic Spline**

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_5-1.png") 
```


## Knot Placement

- One strategy is to decide $K$, the number of knots, and then place them at appropriate quantiles of the observed $X$.
- A cubic spline with $K$ knots has $K + 4$ parameters or degrees of freedom.
- A natural spline with $K$ knots has $K$ degrees of freedom.

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_7-1.png") 
```

`poly(age, deg=14)`


## Smoothing Splines

This section is a little bit mathematical 🛠️  

Consider this criterion for fitting a smooth function $g(x)$ to some data:

$$
\text{minimize}_{g \in S} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - g(x_i))^2 + \lambda \int \left( g''(t) \right)^2 dt
$$

- The first term is RSS, and tries to make $g(x)$ match the data at each $x_i$.
- The second term is a *roughness penalty* and controls how wiggly $g(x)$ is. It is modulated by the *tuning parameter* $\lambda \geq 0$.
  - The smaller $\lambda$, the more wiggly the function, eventually interpolating $y_i$ when $\lambda = 0$.
  - As $\lambda \to \infty$, the function $g(x)$ becomes linear.


## Smoothing Splines Continued

The solution is a natural cubic spline, with a knot at every unique value of $x_i$. The roughness penalty still controls the roughness via $\lambda$.

Some details:

- Smoothing splines avoid the knot-selection issue, leaving a single $\lambda$ to be chosen.

- The algorithmic details are too complex to describe here. In R, the function `smooth.spline()` will fit a smoothing spline.

- The vector of $n$ fitted values can be written as $\hat{g}_\lambda = \mathbf{S}_\lambda \mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{S}_\lambda$ is a $n \times n$ matrix (determined by the $x_i$ and $\lambda$).
- The *effective degrees of freedom* are given by  

$$
  \text{df}_\lambda = \sum_{i=1}^n \{ \mathbf{S}_\lambda \}_{ii}.
$$


## Smoothing Splines Continued — Choosing $\lambda$

- We can specify $\text{df}$ rather than $\lambda$!  

  In R: `smooth.spline(age, wage, df = 10)`
  
- The leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validated error is given by  

$$
  \text{RSS}_{\text{cv}}(\lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( y_i - \hat{g}_\lambda^{(-i)}(x_i) \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ \frac{y_i - \hat{g}_\lambda(x_i)}{1 - \{\mathbf{S}_\lambda\}_{ii}} \right]^2.
$$

  In R: `smooth.spline(age, wage)`


## Smoothing Spline

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_8-1.png") 
```


## Local Regression

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_9-1.png") 
```

With a sliding weight function, we fit separate linear fits over the range of $X$ by weighted least squares.  
See text for more details, and `loess()` function in R.


## Generalized Additive Models

Allows for flexible nonlinearities in several variables, but retains the additive structure of linear models.

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + f_1(x_{i1}) + f_2(x_{i2}) + \cdots + f_p(x_{ip}) + \epsilon_i.
$$

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_11-1.png") 
```

## GAM Details

- Can fit a GAM simply using, e.g., natural splines:  
  `lm(wage ~ ns(year, df = 5) + ns(age, df = 5) + education)`

- Coefficients are not that interesting; fitted functions are. The previous plot was produced using `plot.gam`.

- Can mix terms — some linear, some nonlinear — and use `anova()` to compare models.

- Can use smoothing splines or local regression as well:  
  `gam(wage ~ s(year, df = 5) + lo(age, span = 0.5) + education)`

- GAMs are additive, although low-order interactions can be included in a natural way using, e.g., bivariate smoothers or interactions of the form:  
  `ns(age, df = 5):ns(year, df = 5)`.


## GAMs for Classification

$$
\log\left(\frac{p(X)}{1 - p(X)}\right) = \beta_0 + f_1(X_1) + f_2(X_2) + \cdots + f_p(X_p).
$$

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/7_13-1.png") 
```

`gam(I(wage > 250) ~ year + s(age, df = 5) + education, family = binomial)`
