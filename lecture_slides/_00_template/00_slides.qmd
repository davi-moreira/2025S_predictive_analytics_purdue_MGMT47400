<!---Statistics can be defined as the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data to make informed business decisions. It involves using mathematical theoriesto process numerical information and draw meaningful conclusions. The primary goal of statistics in business is to help managers and decision-makers understand data patterns, trends, and relationships, enabling them to make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, forecast future events, and reduce uncertainty. --->

## Study Design

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="text-align: center; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"}
**Observational**

In observational studies, no attempt is made to control or influence the variables of interest. A survey is a good example.

<br> <br> <br>

> An example of an observational study is researchers observing a randomly selected group of customers that enter a Walmart Supercenter to collect data on variables such as time spent in the store, gender of the customer, and the amount spent.
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="text-align: center; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"}
**Experimental** 

An experimental study involves the active manipulation of one or more independent variables to observe their effect on a dependent variable, while controlling for confounding factors. Participants are typically randomly assigned to groups (e.g., treatment vs. control), and outcomes are compared to determine causal relationships. This design provides strong evidence for cause-and-effect due to the controlled environment and random assignment.

<!---The researcher actively manipulates one or more independent (treatment) variables to observe the effect on a dependent (outcome) variable, while controlling for other potential confounding factors. This type of study aims to establish causal relationships between variables. In an experimental study, subjects are usually randomly assigned to different groups or conditions (e.g., treatment vs. control), and the outcomes are compared to determine the impact of the manipulated variable. The strength of experimental studies lies in their ability to provide strong evidence for cause-and-effect relationships due to the controlled environment and random assignment.--->

> The largest experimental study ever conducted is believed to be the [1954 Public Health Service experiment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1114166/) for the Salk polio vaccine. Nearly two million U.S. children (grades 1 through 3) were selected.
